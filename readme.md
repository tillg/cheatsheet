Dev notes I often need.

## VS Code

## JSHint

In order to code in ES6 and tell this JShint, add a comment at the top of the file: `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` 

## JS, OOP and the sort

* [OOP in JS on Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS)
* Very helpful: [The Object Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/object-explorer/) and [the Array Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/)
* About [Getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) and [Setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) on Mozilla.
